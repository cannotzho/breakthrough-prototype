# Combat Architecture

Technical reference for the combat engine's internal systems. For game design rules, see `Breakthrough_Design.md`.

## State Machine

The combat engine is a pure reducer (`CombatState`, `CombatAction`) → `CombatState` with phase-based routing. `checkState()` is the central router that reads the current state and determines the next phase.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Check
    Check --> PlayerPending : priority > 0
    Check --> BotMSelect : priority ≤ 0 AND hand not empty
    Check --> EnemyPending : priority ≤ 0 AND hand empty
    Check --> EnemyPlay : stagedEnemyCard exists
    Check --> WIN : all opponent shields broken
    Check --> LOSE : patience ≤ 0 / shields lost / lie threshold

    PlayerPending --> Check : PLAY_CARD (effect resolution)
    PlayerPending --> Check : PLACE_SHIELD
    PlayerPending --> Check : END_TURN (priority → 0)
    PlayerPending --> Check : ACTIVATE_ABILITY
    PlayerPending --> RevealPending : effect breaks shield

    BotMSelect --> EnemyPending : CONFIRM_BOTM (handoff bonus applied)

    EnemyPending --> FieldTriggerCheck : TRIGGER_ENEMY_ACTION (selectEnemyCard)
    FieldTriggerCheck --> EnemyPlay : RESOLVE_FIELD_TRIGGERS
    EnemyPlay --> Check : RESOLVE_ENEMY_CARD

    RevealPending --> Check : DISMISS_REVEAL (resume effects)
```

## Effect Resolution

Effects are resolved via `resolveEffectList(state, effects, card, onComplete)`. Each effect is applied via `applyEffect(state, effect, controller, sourceCard)`. The system supports interrupts — if a `pendingReveal` is set mid-resolution, remaining effects are queued and resumed after the player dismisses the reveal.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[resolveEffectList] --> B{For each effect}
    B --> C[applyEffect]
    C --> D{pendingReveal set?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Pause: queue remaining effects → RevealPending]
    D -->|No| B
    B -->|All done| F[onComplete callback]
    F --> G[resolveFieldTriggerCheck]
    G --> H[checkState]
```

### Effect Types

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `MODIFY_PRIORITY` | Adjust shared priority meter (frame) or player meter (classic) |
| `MODIFY_PATIENCE` | Adjust NPC patience |
| `DRAW_CARDS` | Draw N cards from player deck |
| `BREAK_OPPONENT_SHIELD` | Break next shield on controller's opponent side |
| `PLACE_AS_SHIELD` | Flag card for shield placement (pending UI) |
| `INCREMENT_LIE_COUNTER` | +1 to lie counter |
| `PLACE_IMPRESSION` | Place card as persistent impression on field |
| `CREATE_TOKEN` | Create token instance(s) from registry + dispatch `TOKEN_CREATED` |
| `DESTROY_SELF` | Destroy the source card (token or impression) — routes through `destroyToken` for tokens |
| `TRANSFORM_TOKEN` | Replace token(s) of one type with another — uses `removeTokenRaw` (no triggers) |
| `DESTROY_TOKENS` | Destroy multiple tokens by definition ID or instance IDs — reveal-aware looping |
| `APPLY_RESTRICTION` | Apply a temporary restriction on a player/NPC (e.g., prevent shield breaks) |
| `DESTROY_IMPRESSION` | Remove first impression controlled by the acting player |
| `APPLY_REPLACEMENT` | Set a token creation replacement (e.g., "create X instead of Y this turn") |

## Active Restrictions

Restrictions are temporary rules that modify or prevent certain actions. Stored as `activeRestrictions: ActiveRestriction[]` on `CombatState`.

```typescript
interface ActiveRestriction {
  id: string;
  restrictionType: RestrictionType;  // 'PREVENT_SHIELD_BREAK' | 'PREVENT_DRAW' | 'MAX_CARD_COST' | 'INCREASE_CARD_COST'
  target: CardOwner;                 // who is restricted
  value?: number;                    // parameter (e.g., max cost, extra cost amount)
  turnsRemaining: number;            // decrements each turn cycle; removed at 0
}
```

- **Applied** via `APPLY_RESTRICTION` effect (restrictionType, restrictionTarget, restrictionDuration, value)
- **Enforced** inline — e.g., `BREAK_OPPONENT_SHIELD` checks for `PREVENT_SHIELD_BREAK`; `DRAW_CARDS` checks `PREVENT_DRAW`
- **Expired** by `tickRestrictions()`, called at `priorityRestore` (frame) and `classicTurnStart` (classic)

## Effect Conditions

Effects can have an optional `condition: EffectCondition` field. If the condition is not met, the effect is skipped with a log message.

```typescript
type EffectConditionType = 'NPC_CARDS_PLAYED_GTE' | 'FIELD_TOKEN_COUNT_GTE' | 'HAS_FIELD_IMPRESSION';
interface EffectCondition { type: EffectConditionType; value?: number; }
```

- `NPC_CARDS_PLAYED_GTE` — checks `npcCardsPlayedThisTurn >= value` (for Cold Hard Facts, Find Fallacy)
- `npcCardsPlayedThisTurn` is incremented on `RESOLVE_ENEMY_CARD` and reset at turn boundaries

## Token Creation Replacements

Replacements intercept `CREATE_TOKEN` at resolution time, swapping the created token type. Stored as `activeReplacements: ActiveReplacement[]`.

```typescript
interface ActiveReplacement {
  id: string;
  originalTokenId: string;    // intercepted token definition ID
  replacementTokenId: string; // substitute token definition ID
  turnsRemaining: number;
}
```

- **Applied** via `APPLY_REPLACEMENT` effect (replacementOriginalId, replacementTargetId, restrictionDuration)
- **Intercepted** inside `CREATE_TOKEN` handler — if a matching replacement exists, the token type is swapped before creation
- **Expired** alongside restrictions by `tickRestrictions()`

## Shield Trigger Alt Effects

Cards with the `Shield Trigger` keyword can define `shieldTriggerEffects?: CardEffect[]` for effects that fire on shield break instead of their normal `effects`. Resolution uses `shieldTriggerEffects ?? effects` as fallback.

## NPC Card-Play Counter

`npcCardsPlayedThisTurn: number` tracks how many cards the NPC has played in the current turn cycle. Incremented on `RESOLVE_ENEMY_CARD`, reset at `priorityRestore` (frame) and `classicTurnStart` (classic). Used by `NPC_CARDS_PLAYED_GTE` condition.

## Token Lifecycle

Tokens are persistent field cards created by `CREATE_TOKEN` effects and stored in `CombatState.fieldTokens`. They support activated abilities (player-initiated) and leave-the-battlefield triggers (automatic on destruction).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[CREATE_TOKEN effect] --> B[Token added to fieldTokens]
    B --> C[dispatchGameEvent: TOKEN_CREATED]

    D[Token destroyed] --> E{Destruction path}
    E -->|destroyToken| F[Remove from fieldTokens]
    F --> G[Resolve leavesTriggerEffects]
    G --> H[dispatchGameEvent: TOKEN_DESTROYED]

    E -->|removeTokenRaw| I[Remove from fieldTokens only]
    I --> J[No triggers, no events]

    style I fill:#555,color:#fff
    style J fill:#555,color:#fff
```

### Two Removal Paths (by design)

- **`destroyToken(state, instanceId)`** — Full lifecycle: removes the token, fires its `leavesTriggerEffects` (with reveal-aware pausing), then dispatches `TOKEN_DESTROYED` to passive listeners. Used by: `DESTROY_SELF` effect, `DESTROY_TOKEN` action, and any future forced-destruction effects.

- **`removeTokenRaw(state, instanceId)`** — Silent removal: removes the token without firing any triggers or events. Used exclusively by `TRANSFORM_TOKEN`, where the token is being converted to another type, not leaving the battlefield.

This separation is structural, not conditional — transform must never accidentally route through `destroyToken`.

### Transform Token

`TRANSFORM_TOKEN` replaces token(s) of one definition type with another. It uses `removeTokenRaw` for the old tokens (no leave triggers) and creates new token instances, dispatching `TOKEN_CREATED` for each.

```typescript
interface CardEffect {
  type: 'TRANSFORM_TOKEN';
  transformSourceId: string;   // definition ID to find on field
  transformTargetId: string;   // definition ID to create
  value?: number;              // max count (default 1)
  transformAll?: boolean;      // transform all matching tokens
  transformUpTo?: boolean;     // allow fewer than value
}
```

### Nested Reveal Handling

When `destroyToken`'s leave-trigger effects include shield breaks, each break sets a `pendingReveal`. The system handles this correctly:

1. `destroyToken` applies leave effects one at a time
2. On `pendingReveal`, remaining leave effects are queued into `state.pendingEffects`
3. `resolveEffectList` detects the reveal and merges its own remaining effects into `pendingEffects`
4. `DISMISS_REVEAL` clears `pendingEffects` from state before resuming to prevent duplicates
5. Each reveal is shown sequentially until all effects resolve

### Token Definition Fields

```typescript
interface CardDefinition {
  // ... existing fields ...
  leavesTriggerEffects?: CardEffect[];    // fired when token is destroyed (not transformed)
  activatedAbilities?: ActivatedAbility[]; // player-initiated abilities with costs
  triggeredAbilities?: TriggeredAbility[]; // passive listeners for game events
}
```

## Game Event Dispatch

Field cards (impressions and tokens) can declare passive `triggeredAbilities` that react to game-wide events. When a game event occurs, `dispatchGameEvent(state, event)` scans all field cards for matching triggers and resolves their effects.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Game Event occurs] --> B[dispatchGameEvent]
    B --> C{Scan fieldImpressions + fieldTokens}
    C --> D{Card has triggeredAbility matching event?}
    D -->|No| C
    D -->|Yes| E{controllerFilter matches?}
    E -->|No| C
    E -->|Yes| F[Resolve ability effects]
    F --> G[triggerDepth++ for recursion protection]
    G --> C
    C -->|All cards checked| H[Return updated state]
```

### Event Types

| Event | Fired when | Used by |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `TOKEN_DESTROYED` | `destroyToken()` completes | Eloquence, Lingering Words |
| `TOKEN_CREATED` | `CREATE_TOKEN` effect resolves | (reserved for future use) |
| `CARD_PLAYED` | (not yet wired) | (reserved for future use) |
| `SHIELD_BROKEN` | (not yet wired) | (reserved for future use) |

### Triggered Ability Definition

```typescript
interface TriggeredAbility {
  id: string;
  trigger: GameEventType;        // which event to listen for
  controllerFilter?: CardOwner;  // if set, only fires when event source matches controller
  effects: CardEffect[];         // effects to resolve
}
```

Example — Eloquence: "Every time a token is destroyed, draw a card"
```typescript
triggeredAbilities: [{
  id: 'eloquence_draw',
  trigger: 'TOKEN_DESTROYED',
  effects: [{ type: 'DRAW_CARDS', value: 1 }],
}]
```

Example — Lingering Words: "Every time a token you control is destroyed, create a Logical Chain"
```typescript
triggeredAbilities: [{
  id: 'lingering_words_chain',
  trigger: 'TOKEN_DESTROYED',
  controllerFilter: 'player',
  effects: [{ type: 'CREATE_TOKEN', tokenDefinitionId: 'logical_chain', value: 1 }],
}]
```

## Recursion Protection

All trigger-based systems share the `triggerDepth` counter on `CombatState`, capped at `MAX_TRIGGER_DEPTH` (20). This prevents infinite loops from:
- Trap → effect → trap chains
- Shield trigger → effect → shield trigger chains
- Token leave trigger → create token → destroy token → leave trigger chains
- Passive listener → create token → listener chains

## Priority Modes

### Frame Mode (`'frame'`)

Single shared priority meter (clamped −10 to +10). Priority > 0 = player's turn; ≤ 0 = NPC's turn.

- Card costs deduct from priority
- NPC card costs push priority positive (self-limiting)
- `applyTurnHandoffBonus(priority, side)` adds ±3 on turn switch
- `priorityRestore` fires when priority flips from ≤ 0 to > 0: applies handoff bonus, returns BotM cards, draws to hand limit, expires traps

### Classic Mode (`'classic'`)

Separate priority meters. Explicit turn alternation via `activeTurn` flag.
